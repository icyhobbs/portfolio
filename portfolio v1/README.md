my portfolio built to the expectations as provided
developers name, and recent photo or avatar
links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
links scroll to the corresponding section
link about work scrolls to titled images of applications (placeholder)
developers first application should be larger in size than the others
the application image should be larger in size than the others
when images are click they are taken to the deployed application
when page resizes to various screens and devices a responsive layout adapts to viewport

worked very conceptually to provide a simple yet visually appealing pallette for the viewer to peruse.
may it dazzle thine eyes!
