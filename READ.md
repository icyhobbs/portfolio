JavaScript: Password Generator

Current working conditions in areas that cater to sensitive data dictate a need for strong passwords that will offer an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. I modified starter code (if you could even call it that), to create an application/site that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

The passwords generated can include special characters, numbers, lower and uppercase characters as well. Once the password is generated on the page, it's a simple copy and paste to utilize it where needed.

Cheers!!
